# FireAPI

This FastAPI Project uses Firebase Authentication, Firestore for database and Cloud Run to deploy containerized service.
All this was using the free tier from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

## Getting started

As I mentioned before I'm using services from Firebase and GCP, so You should start with a google account and activate
those services. I suggest beginning with the GCP project and then creating a Firebase project importing the same GCP
project. All this is in order to use the same permissions and billing account (Yeah you need a billing account with a
valid credit card, but remember it's just for enabling services because we will be using "the free tier").
